                <h2 class="intro__title">What haven't we seen there?</h2>
                <p class="intro__text">According to a survey by VTSIOM, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their vacation within the country. They think, what haven’t we seen at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe, with the gentle seas of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains, and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau. And all this beauty can be seen without millions in your bank account, a foreign passport, and long flights. Just like Vera Bashmakova — a brave young mother who took her three children, put them in her "Lada," and drove 20,000 kilometers across her native country. We’ve selected and described some interesting places that deserve your vacation.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph">But Kaliningrad Oblast doesn’t stop there. For travelers and explorers, nearby lies the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic Spit — and the German heritage of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places excludes hustle and bustle, immersing you in the tranquility of nature and the scent of the cool, steel-colored sea.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. Primarily because of the mountains: if you travel along the ridge, you’ll see slopes covered with pines, mountain rivers, and lakes. And if you open the windows of your car, you’ll encounter the invisible wonder of this region — mountain air.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so the best time to visit is summer. This way, you’ll see the full variety of local flora and fauna. In the Altai forests, moose roam, eagles fly above the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls — they’re also inhabitants of the Altai region.</p>

                        <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is also the perfect place for skijoring competitions. This is a sport where a skier attaches themselves to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to reach the highest possible speed on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was set at the "Baikal Mile" festival — 197.011 km/h.</p>

But here, it reaches 30 meters tall — the forests of Karelia's national parks, due to impenetrable swamps, have never seen an axe. Some pine trees are over five hundred years old. Touch a living being that saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible did. In the virgin forest, there isn’t a trail for a hundred kilometers. And on the rare paths, trees just a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. To let everyone know who the real boss is here.</p>
